This script utilizes several Python libraries to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on an image, correct its grammar, and save the corrected transcription to a text file. It employs pytesseract for OCR, PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing, language_tool_python for grammar correction, and tqdm for displaying a progress bar. The script first performs OCR on the image, then corrects the grammar of the extracted text, and finally saves the corrected transcription to a text file.
